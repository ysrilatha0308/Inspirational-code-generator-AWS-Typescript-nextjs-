# Inspirational-code-generator-AWS-Typescript-nextjs
I am using Next.js, TypeScript, and AWS to build a full stack inspirational quote generator app.

In this epic build, I'm going to create a completely serverless quote generator using AWS as our cloud back-end and NextJS/TypeScript as our front-end.

The most epic part is...I'm going to be generating images in a server without any expensive software or hardware.

First, install the project dependencies from the root of the project:

npm i
# or
npm install
Next, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
